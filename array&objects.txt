Question 1.

For the given JASON iterate over all for loops(for, for in , for of, for each)

We can iterate over its properties and values using various types of loops and methods

assume that  following JSON object:

var data = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
};


Using a for...in loop to iterate over the keys:

for (var key in data) {
  console.log(key, data[key]);
}


OUTPUT:

name John
 age 30
city New York


Using a for...of loop to iterate over the values:

for (var value of Object.values(data)) {
  console.log(value);
}


OUTPUT:
John
30
Mew York


If you're using a library like Lodash, you can use its _.forEach function:

  QUESTION 3. 

  Read about the difference between Windows, screen and document in javascript.

  (i)  Windows object:

     a. The 'window' object represents the global browser window or tab that contains the web page.
     b. It is the top-level object in the browser's object model and serves as the global context 
     for JavaScript code running in a web page.
     c.You can access and manipulate properties and methods related to the browser window, 
     such as opening new windows, setting timers, and handling events.
     d. You can also define global variables and functions in the context of the window object.

     Example:

     window.alert("This is an alert");
     window.location.href = "https://www.example.com";


(ii) Screen object:

    a.The 'screen' object represents the user's screen or monitor and provides information about the screen's properties.
    b.It offers details like screen width, height, color depth, and pixel density (DPI).
    c.You can use the 'screen' object to adjust the layout or behavior of your web page based on 
    the user's screen characteristics.

    Example:

    console.log("Screen width: " + screen.width);
    console.log("Screen height: " + screen.height);

 (iii) Document object:

    a. The 'document' object represents the DOM (Document Object Model) of the current web page.
    b. It allows you to access and manipulate the HTML content, structure, and elements of the page.
    c.  You can use the 'document' object to modify the content, create or remove elements, respond to events,
        and interact with the web page's structure and layout.
    d. It's a critical object for working with HTML and JavaScript in the context of a web page.
